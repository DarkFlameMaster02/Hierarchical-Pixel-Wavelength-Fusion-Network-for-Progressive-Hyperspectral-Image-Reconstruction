##Introduction
We propose Hierarchical Pixel- Wavelength Fusion Network (HPWF-Net) to address the challenges of tree species classification and spectral reconstruction in complex forest ecosystems.

HPWF- Net utilizes an enhanced U-Net architecture with multi-level loss supervision and convolutional consistency constraints, enabling accurate reconstruction by supervising intermediate encoder outputs, convolutional regressions, and final decoder predictions.

Experimental results demonstrate that the reconstructed hyperspectral data improve tree species classification accuracy by 5.9% compared to the original Sentinel-2 multispectral data. 
This work contributes to hyperspectral reconstruction and fine-grained ecological monitoring, offering a practical solution for remote sensing applications in forest ecosystems.

We are packaging the environment configuration file and making the final code changes...
